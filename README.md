# Mini-games

This is a repository of mini games that I created in Java.
The games include
  1. Piglatin - 
This game takes any word as input from a user and translates it into a word in piglatin!
  2. ReverseGuess - 
This game allows a user to think of a number and the computer will continue to guess the number until it gets it right
  3. EvenSums - 
This game runs a program that takes user input and returns the sum of all the even numbers entered
